This custom component provides full climate control for air conditioners manufactured by Hisense and its OEM brands (Ballu, etc.) that use the RS-485 protocol. It has been tested on:

❄️ **Hisense CITY DC Inverter AS-13UW4RYRCM04G/04W** 

❄️ **Hisense SILVER CRYSTAL SUPER DC Inverter AS-13UW4RVETG01**

❄️ **Newtek NT-77HSDC12**

❄️ **Ballu iGreen Pro DC BSAGI-07HN8, BSAGI-12HN8**  

❄️  **Ballu iGreen Pro DC BSAGI-18HN8_V4**

❄️  **Ballu Platinum DC BSEI-09HN8_V3**

❄️  **Hisense Free Match Multi Split 4AMW81U4RJC**

and should work with many other models.

The component exposes a standard Home Assistant Climate entity, along with a set of optional sensors and switches to access all advanced features of the AC (turbo, eco, quiet, sleep, swing, LED, iFeel (temperature from any sensor from the home assistant) etc.).

## Hardware requirements

-   An ESP32 board
-   An RS-485 transceiver (e.g., MAX485) connected to UART pins
-   Wiring:  
    \- A (RS-485) → A of transceiver  
    \- B (RS-485) → B of transceiver  
    \- Transceiver's RXD to ESP RX pin (e.g., GPIO16)  
    \- Transceiver's TXD to ESP TX pin (e.g., GPIO17)  
    \- **direct connection (not cross-connection)**  
    \- Power (3.3V or 5V depending on module) and GND

> ⚠️ The AC uses 5V logic levels on its RS‑485 port. Make sure your transceiver is 3.3V‑tolerant if you power the ESP from 3.3V.

Transceivers with automatic direction switching (TXD/RXD only) need no extra wiring. A bare MAX485 (DI/DE/RE/RO pins) needs the driver enabled while transmitting: wire DE and RE together to one GPIO and set `flow_control_pin`, or keep them separate and set `de_pin` and `re_pin`. The component drives the pin(s) HIGH for the duration of each frame and LOW otherwise.

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: ac_hi
    # ...
    flow_control_pin: GPIO21   # DE + RE bridged
    # or: de_pin: GPIO21 / re_pin: GPIO17
```

```

### Electrical sensors (power, voltage, current)

`power` (W), `voltage` (V) and `current` (A) sensors are created by default, like the other status sensors, and are populated only when the indoor unit sends the long status frame (see the protocol section below). The current reported by the AC is an integer, so a finer value can be derived as power / voltage with a template sensor. For the Home Assistant Energy dashboard combine `power` with `total_daily_energy`; add a `heartbeat` filter so the energy keeps integrating while the power value is constant:

```yaml
time:
  - platform: homeassistant

climate:
  - platform: ac_hi
    # ...
    power:
      name: "Power"
      id: ac_power
      filters:
        - heartbeat: 30s
    voltage:
      name: "Voltage"
    current:

### Climate (`climate`)

-   Modes: `OFF`, `COOL`, `HEAT`, `DRY`, `FAN_ONLY` (auto mode is not supported by the AC, auto mode is implemented by enabling smart mode)
-   Fan speeds: `AUTO`, `QUIET`, `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `TURBO`
-   Swing modes: `OFF`, `VERTICAL`, `HORIZONTAL`, `BOTH`
-   Presets (if `enable_presets: true`): `ECO`, `BOOST` (turbo), `SLEEP`, `QUIET`, `+8 °C`
-   Target temperature range: 16–30°C in steps of 1°C
-   Current temperature is read from the AC and displayed

### DRY offset (`number`)

Set `enable_dry_offset: true` to create a `Dry Offset` number entity in Home Assistant.
While the AC is in DRY mode, it accepts values from `-7` to `+7` and sends the
corresponding native DRY adjustment to the indoor unit. The control is rejected
while another HVAC mode is active.

### Sleep programs

The `SLEEP` preset activates one of four pre-programmed temperature adjustment curves built into the indoor unit. The AC automatically adjusts the target temperature and reduces fan speed overnight. Sleep ends automatically after ~8 hours.

In **cooling mode**, the programs behave as follows (offsets relative to your set temperature):

| Program | Temperature curve (cooling) |
|---------|-------------|
| Sleep 1 — Hold | +2°C over the first 2 hours, then holds |
| Sleep 2 — Standard | +2°C over 2 hours, then drops back: −1°C at ~6h, −1°C at ~7h |
| Sleep 3 — Wake Cool | +1°C after 1h, +2°C after 2h, then drops: −2°C at ~6h, −1°C at ~7h |
| Sleep 4 — Steady | Maintains your set temperature all night (no curve) |

Hisense describes these as targeting different comfort preferences (Sleep 2 is the default). Sleep 4 is effectively "fixed temperature + quiet fan."

> **Note:** Exact curves may vary by model. The above is documented in Hisense service manuals ([source](https://hisense.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/manual-AST-24UW4SDBTG10-1.pdf)).

**How it works:**
- Selecting `SLEEP` preset in HA sends the chosen program code to the AC
- The AC takes over fan speed (drops to quiet) and adjusts the setpoint according to the program's built-in curve
- After ~8 hours the AC returns to normal operation
- The `Sleep Program` select entity picks which program is used the next time you activate Sleep
- The `sleep_stage` sensor reports the currently active program (0 = off, 1–4 = active program)


### Sensors (optional)

Most sensors publish raw values received from the AC:

| Sensor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `set_temperature` | Target temperature setpoint (°C) |
| `room_temperature` | Current indoor temperature (°C) |
| `outdoor_temperature` | Outdoor air temperature (°C, signed) |
| `outdoor_condenser_temperature` | Outdoor condenser temperature (°C, signed) |
| `pipe_temperature` | Indoor pipe temperature (°C) |
| `wind` | Raw fan speed code (0–18) |
| `sleep_stage` | Sleep stage code (0–4) |
| `mode_code` | AC mode code (0–3) |
| `quiet` | Quiet mode active (binary) |
| `turbo` | Turbo mode active (binary) |
| `economy` | Eco mode active (binary) |
| `swing_up_down` | Vertical swing active (binary) |
| `swing_left_right` | Horizontal swing active (binary) |
| `compressor_frequency_set` | Target compressor frequency (Hz) |
| `compressor_frequency` | Actual compressor frequency (Hz) |
| `compressor_exhaust_temperature` | Compressor Exhaust Temperature (°C) |
| `power_status` | Text sensor showing "ON" or "OFF" |

### Switches (optional)

-   `led_switch`: Controls the indoor unit’s LED backlight.
-   `command_sound` : Command reception sound control.

## How it works

The component communicates with the AC via a simple request/response protocol over RS‑485.

-   **Polling:** Every `update_interval` (default 1s) a short status query (command `0x66`) is sent.
-   **Write commands:** When you change a setting through Home Assistant, the component accumulates changes for 200 ms (debounce) and then sends a full state write (command `0x65`) with a correctly calculated CRC.
-   **Convergence logic:** While HA has priority, the component continues to enforce the desired state until the AC confirms it (by sending a status frame that matches the desired signature). After convergence, remote changes (e.g., from the IR remote) are again accepted and reflected in HA.
-   **CRC validation:** All incoming frames are checked for CRC correctness; invalid frames are discarded.
-   **Write lock timeout:** If the AC does not acknowledge a write within 5 seconds, the lock is released to avoid permanent blocking.

## Protocol specification (reverse engineered)

This section documents the RS‑485 protocol used by Hisense/Ballu ACs. It may be useful for understanding the implementation or for adapting it to other models.

### Frame format

All frames start with header `0xF4 0xF5` and end with tail `0xF4 0xFB`. The length of the frame is variable and is given by `frame[4] + 9` bytes.

| Byte offset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0xF4 (header) |
| 1 | 0xF5 (header) |
| 2 | Unknown (usually 0x00) |
| 3 | Unknown (usually 0x40) |
| 4 | Declared length L – total frame size = L + 9 |
| 5 … 8 | Unknown (often 0x00) |
| 9 … 12 | Unknown (often 0x01 0xFE 0x01 0x00) |
| 13 | Command (0x65 – write, 0x66 – read status, 0x??) |
| 14 … L+4 | Payload |
| L+5 … L+6 | CRC (16‑bit sum of bytes 2 … L+4, big‑endian) |
| L+7 … L+8 | Tail 0xF4 0xFB |

### Status response (command 0x66, byte 13 = 102)

When the AC receives a short query (0x66 frame), it responds with a long status frame (command 102). The payload contains all operational data.

**Relevant bytes (0‑based within the frame):**

| Index | Description | Encoding / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | Fan speed | Reported values: 0/1/2 = AUTO, 10 = QUIET, 12 = LOW, 14 = MEDIUM, 16 = HIGH |
| 17 | Sleep mode | Raw value. Decode: `(value >> 1)` gives sleep stage: 0 = off, 1 = sleep\_1, 2 = sleep\_2, 4 = sleep\_3, 8 = sleep\_4 |
| 18 | Power + Mode | Bit 3 = power (1=ON). Upper nibble = mode: 0=FAN\_ONLY, 1=HEAT, 2=COOL, 3=DRY |
| 19 | Target temperature | Direct °C value (16–30) |
| 20 | Current indoor temperature | °C |
| 21 | Pipe temperature | °C |
| 32 | Swing | Bits: bit7 = up/down on, bit6 = left/right on |
| 33 | Turbo/Eco flags (RX) | bit1 = turbo, bit2 = eco |
| 35 | Quiet (RX) | bit2 = quiet active |
| 36 | LED (RX) | bit7 = LED on |
| 37 | ... | (unused) |
| 42 | Compressor target frequency | Hz |
| 43 | Compressor actual frequency | Hz |
| 44 | Outdoor air temperature | °C (signed int8\_t) |
| 45 | Outdoor condenser temperature | °C (signed int8\_t) |
| 50 | Mains voltage | V (byte 51 is always 0, so possibly uint16 LE). Long status frame only |
| 55–56 | Input power | W, **uint16 big-endian** (55 = high byte, 56 = low byte). Long status frame only |
| 60 | Input current | A, integer (rounded). Long status frame only |
| 144–145 | Copy of the input power | uint16 little-endian, same value as bytes 55–56 |

Some indoor units answer the status query with a **150-byte frame** (byte 4 = 0x8D). Bytes 50, 55–56 and 60 of that frame carry the electrical data that the original Wi‑Fi module exposes to the cloud as voltage / power (verified on a Hisense split with the AEH‑W4G1 module: 20 Hz → 110 W / 0 A, 46 Hz → 1740 W / 8 A at 226 V; power / voltage matches the current byte). Units that reply with the short frame do not have these fields and the related sensors stay unknown.

### Write command (command 0x65)

To change settings, a full state frame is sent. The payload is built from the desired values. The CRC must be calculated over bytes 2 … L+4.

**Encoding rules (TX):**

| Field | Encoding |
| --- | --- |
| Target temperature | `((c & 0x1F) << 1) | 0x01` where c = 16…30 |
| Fan speed | Base codes: AUTO=1, QUIET=10, LOW=12, MEDIUM=14, HIGH=16. **TX value = base + 1** |
| Sleep mode | `((code) << 1) | 0x01` where code = 0,1,2,4,8 for off,1,2,3,4 |
| Power | low nibble of byte 18: ON = 0b1100, OFF = 0b0100 |
| Mode | high nibble of byte 18: FAN\_ONLY = 0x10, HEAT = 0x30, COOL = 0x50, DRY = 0x70 |
| Turbo | byte 33: ON = 0b1100, OFF = 0b0100 (Turbo overrides Eco) |
| Eco | byte 33: ON = 0b110000, OFF = 0b010000 (combined with Turbo) |
| Quiet | byte 35: ON = 0b110000, OFF = 0b010000 |
| Swing | byte 32: UD ON = 0b11000000, OFF = 0b01000000; LR ON = 0b00110000, OFF = 0b00010000; combined by addition |
| LED | byte 36: ON = 0b11000000, OFF = 0b01000000 |

### CRC calculation

CRC is a simple 16‑bit sum (big‑endian) of bytes starting from index 2 up to index `L+4` (i.e., excluding header, tail, and the CRC bytes themselves). The sum is stored as two bytes: high byte at offset `L+5`, low byte at `L+6`.

Example in C++:

```cpp
uint16_t crc = 0;
for (int i = 2; i < frame.size() - 4; i++) {
    crc += frame[i];
}
frame[frame.size() - 4] = (crc >> 8) & 0xFF;
frame[frame.size() - 3] = crc & 0xFF;
```

## Troubleshooting

-   **No communication:** Check wiring, baud rate (9600), and ensure that the RS‑485 transceiver is powered correctly.
-   **Wrong outdoor temperature:** The value is signed. If you see 244°C, it means –12°C was misinterpreted. This has been fixed in the component.
-   **Commands not working:** Enable verbose logging (`esp_log_level: VERBOSE`) and inspect the TX/RX frames. Compare them with the protocol specification.
